/**
 * This ruleset enforces a strict staff-ownership model for a payroll and attendance application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * The security model is centered around the "staff member" as the owner of their data.
 * An authenticated user's UID is expected to match the `staffId` in the path, granting them
 * exclusive access to their personal information, attendance records, payments, and salaries.
 * This ensures that staff members can only see and manage their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data is hierarchically organized under the `/staff/{staffId}` path. This top-level
 * document contains the staff member's profile. Nested subcollections for `attendance_records`,
 * `advance_payments`, and `salaries` store related data, inheriting ownership from the
 * parent `staffId`.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Staff Data Privacy: A staff member can only access documents within their own data tree
 *   (i.e., where the path's `staffId` matches their authenticated UID).
 * - No Staff Enumeration: Listing the entire `/staff` collection is explicitly disallowed
 *   to prevent any user from discovering the list of all other staff members.
 * - Relational Integrity: On creation, documents within subcollections (e.g., an attendance record)
 *   must include a `staffId` field that matches the `staffId` in the document path. This field
 *   is enforced as immutable to maintain a permanent, unbreakable link to the parent staff member.
 * - Prototyping Flexibility: While authorization is strict, these rules do not validate the
 *   specific shape or data types of documents beyond the fields essential for security. This allows
 *   the application's data model to evolve without requiring constant rule updates.
